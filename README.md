# hello-world
This is my first project in GitHub
I want to talk a few line about agile development in the software industry.
When I first encountered agile development, I found it hard to understand. Okay, I might not be the brightest person you’ve ever met! But I’m not stupid either, I think :-)

There’s a myriad of different approaches, principles, methods and terms, all of which are characterised as ‘Agile’. And from my perspective, all this ‘noise’ makes agile software development sound far harder, far more scientific, and far more confusing than it really needs to be.

For this reason, I favour the Scrum agile methodology. Admittedly there’s a bit of jargon to learn. But otherwise Scrum provides what is fundamentally a very simple way of managing software development more effectively.
